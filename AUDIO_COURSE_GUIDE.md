## 🔧 Key Concepts for Viral Clip Generation

### **1. Audio Signal Creation**
```python
# Create audio signals for viral clips
sample_rate = 22050
t = np.linspace(0, duration, int(sample_rate * duration))
audio = np.sin(2 * np.pi * frequency * t)
```

### **2. Feature Extraction**
```python
# Extract features for viral prediction
mfcc = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=audio, sr=sample_rate)
tempo, beats = librosa.beat.beat_track(y=audio, sr=sample_rate)
```

### **3. Audio Enhancement**
```python
# Enhance audio for viral clips
enhanced = audio + 10  # Increase volume
fade_audio = audio.fade_in(1000).fade_out(1000)
```

### **4. Speech Transcription**
```python
# Transcribe speech for content analysis
result = model.transcribe(audio_file)
text = result['text']
```
