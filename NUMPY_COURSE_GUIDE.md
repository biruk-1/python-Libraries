## 🔧 Key Concepts for Viral Clip Generation

### **1. Image Processing**
```python
# Represent images as NumPy arrays
image = np.random.randint(0, 256, (height, width, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
# Apply filters and transformations
brightened = np.clip(image * 1.5, 0, 255).astype(np.uint8)
```

### **2. Audio Processing**
```python
# Create and manipulate audio signals
sample_rate = 22050
t = np.linspace(0, duration, int(sample_rate * duration))
audio = np.sin(2 * np.pi * frequency * t)
```

### **3. Feature Extraction**
```python
# Extract features from video data
features = np.random.randn(num_videos, num_features)
viral_scores = np.dot(features, weights)
```

### **4. Batch Processing**
```python
# Process multiple videos efficiently
for i in range(0, num_videos, batch_size):
    batch = features[i:i+batch_size]
    batch_scores = np.dot(batch, weights)
```
